# Tabs Component Test Challenge

Your task is to create a component test for the `vTabs` and `vTabPanel` components that we created earlier in the training.

## Requirements

1. Test that the tab titles are rendered based on the title props of `vTabPanel`
2. Test that the content is rendered based on the content passed to the `vTabPanel` default slot
3. Test that the only content for the active tab is visible
4. Test that clicking the tab titles changes the content that is displayed.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Feel free to use TypeScript to make your component tests type safe if you'd like. This is NOT required however.

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: Run the tests with `yarn test:unit`
